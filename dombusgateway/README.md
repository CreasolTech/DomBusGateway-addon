# DomBusGateway
Gateway that **interfaces one or more DomBus networks of home automation modules with MQTT AutoDiscovery**

## What is DomBusGateway Home Assistant addon

This is an addon that can be automatically installed into HAOS (Home Assistant Operating System) by clicking on Settings -> Addon


## What is DomBus?

It's a custom protocol developed by [Creasol](https://www.creasol.it/domotics) to communicate with home automation modules using a **RS485 serial bus, made by a standard alarm cable within 4 wires**, 2 for data at 115200bps, 2 for 12-24V to supply all devices.

It's a **multi-master protocol**, where each **DomBus module can start communicating to the controller for example when an input changes** (for example a counter, alarm sensor, pushbutton), with a low latency (typically less than 100ms).

Also, it supports the so-called *DCMD*, commands sent between modules triggered by a input change or when a condition becomes true. **DCMD can be used to realize simple automations that work even when the main controller (Domoticz, Home Assistant, ...) is frozen or OFF, similarly to [KNX](https://www.knx.org/)**.


## What are DomBus modules?

They are **very low power consumption devices** with several **versatile I/Os and sensors**, performing general or specific functions, that can be used in building automations. 
They can be factory programmed with **DomBus** custom protocol, or **Modbus** standard protocol.

A list of DomBus modules can be found below.


## For what home automation systems can DomBus modules be used?

DomBus modules equipped with DomBus firmware can be used with:
* [Domoticz](https://wiki.domoticz.com/Creasol_Dombus), using the **CreasolDomBus plugin**
* [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/), [NodeRED](https://nodered.org/), [ioBroker](https://www.iobroker.net/) and other systems supporting MQTT, by using the **DomBusGateway** software that acts as a **DomBus to MQTT-AD gateway**. 
* Other building automation systems supporting **Modbus** protocol can use DomBus modules equipped with Modbus firmware.


## For HomeAssistant, is it better DomBus + DomBusGateway, or Modbus protocol?

**DomBus firmware + DomBusGateway** implementation is quick and simple, because **all devices/entities are created automatically** without any specific integration. **Enable MQTT integration, start DomBusGateway software, connect one or more DomBus modules, and all DomBus ports are immediately visible in your home automation system**.
Also, DomBus protocol is a must in case that DCMD, pushbuttons, alarm sensors and counters are needed.

Modbus may be used for relay modules, EVSE module (to make your own electric vehicle charging wallbox), Dual axis solar tracker. **Modbus is not recommended in case that pushbuttons, alarm sensors and counters have to be used**, because Modbus is a master-slave protocol where the controller have to poll continuosly all Modbus modules to get their input status, introducing delays.

## Example: DomBusEVSE module used to make a Smart Wallbox with Home Assistant

Using DomBusGateway software, Home Assistant is able to automatically create, read and manage all entities of the DomBusEVSE module: MQTT integration have to be enabled, of course!

Then it's possible to arrange entities in a custom dashboard as shown below:

![HomeAssistant Dashboard for the Home Made Wallbox using DomBusEVSE module](https://images.creasol.it/creDomBusEVSE_dashboard3.webp)

More information about the DomBusEVSE module, that can be used to make a home made wallbox working with HomeAssistant, NodeRED, OpenHAB, Domoticz, can be found at https://www.creasol.it/EVSE and https://store.creasol.it . Also, please check the section _DomBusEVSE module to build a DIY EV charger_ below
		
![DomBusGateway, a DomBus 2 MQTT bridge](https://images.creasol.it/dombusgateway_block1.webp)
## How does DomBusGateway work?

Once executed, using the command _python3 dombusgateway.py &_ , it opens **one or more serial ports connected to DomBus modules** (to get a reliable large network, it's possible to divide the DomBus network in trunks with 20-30 modules/each, or divide the building by floors/zones). It's also possible to use **WiFi/LAN RS485 modules that provide a virtual serial interface**, to get a wireless connection between the main controller where DomBusateway runs, and RS485 port physically connected to the DomBus modules. 

If MQTT is enabled, it **opens a connection to the MQTT broker** to exchange data (sending device states and reading command from the domotic controller).

If TELNET port is enabled, **the user can connect DomBusGateway by Telnet to check the network of modules and set configuration parameters for each module**. DomBus modules usually have configurable I/Os, for example a I/O should be configured as digital input, analog input, counter, energy counter, and so on, and this configuration can be done by Telnet.

**The software is still experimental, in development stage! Any contribution (testing and development) is welcome!**

# Files and directories

* _dombusgateway.py_: main server that must be runned in background, calling _python3 dombusgateway.py &_

* _dombusgateway_const.py_: script with several constants used by _dombusgateway.py_

* _dombusgateway_conf.py_: configuration file that must NOT be changed by the user

* _local/dombusgateway_conf_local.py_: local configuration file with custom configuration: this is the right place to store your local configuration, that will not be overwritten by git command

* _data/_: directory, created if not existing, where list of DomBus modules and configuration is saved and restored

* _/var/log/dombusgateway_: directory where logs are stored

* _/etc/systemd/system/dombusgateway.service_: service configuration file for systemd



# DomBusGateway installation

## In a normal Linux environment

From the shell, run the command:

__sudo bash -c "$(curl -sSfL https://creasol.it/DBGinstall)"__

that will automatically install the package in _/opt/DomBusGateway_ and run it from systemd.

DomBusGateway daemon then can be stopped and started by systemd, using the commands:

__systemctl stop dombusgateway__

__systemctl start dombusgateway__

When installed, to update the software with the last version, it's sufficient to enter the following commands:

__cd  /opt/DomBusGateway; git pull; systemctl restart dombusgateway__



## In HAOS / HASSOS (Home Asisstant Operating System)

TODO: ADDON installation in HAOS


## DomBusGateway hardware

It's also possible to find some images for SBC/MiniPC that will be used as a real DomBusGateway hardware, with USB port to connect a DomBus network of modules by one USB/RS485 adapter, or to connect a USB hub in case that more USB ports are needed, and one LAN port or WiFi to connect the home automation system by MQTT or MQTT-AD.

### DomBusGateway on Rock PI S

[**The ready-to-use device, with Linux + DomBusGateway + Mosquitto already installed, can be purchased from store.creasol.it**](https://store.creasol.it/dombusgatewaypis) . It's based on the Rock PI S hardware, a tiny ARM computer with only 400mW power usage, 4 cores, 512MB RAM.

Alternatively, it's possible to download the following files:
* https://docs.creasol.it/dombusgatewaypis.sfdisk
* https://docs.creasol.it/dombusgatewaypis.boot.img.gz 
* https://docs.creasol.it/dombusgatewaypis.fsa 

and from the shell of a linux computer write the following commands to write a 64GB (or more) microSD:
```
export disk=/dev/sdX   (replace x with the number associated to the microSD device)
zcat dombusgatewaypis.boot.img.gz >${disk}	
sfdisk $disk < dombusgatewaypis.sfdisk
fsarchiver -v restfs dombusgatewaypis.fsa id=0,dest=${disk}1 id=1,dest=${disk}2
```
Then put the microSD in the Rock PI S hardware and enjoy!
[![DomBusGatewayPIS: DomBusGateway + mosquitto + firewall + backup system running on a Rock PI S minicomputer](https://images.creasol.it/dombusgateway_rockpis.webp)](https://store.creasol.it/dombusgatewaypis)

The Rock PI S is programmed with a Linux firmware that minimize writing to disk, by having */tmp* and */var/log* partitions in ramfs (volatile memory): in this way the microSD life will be extended. It's possible to access the operating system by SSH (port 22), connecting the IP addressed assigned by DHCP (check the router or scan the network to find its IP address) using:\
username: **pi** , password: **arangingenni**\
username: **root** , password: **geriandallse**

Login by SSH protocol using **pi** user, then type **sudo su -** to get root priviledges. Passwords can be modified by using the *passwd* command, of course.

Also, the system runs *mosquitto* MQTT broker that can be accessed on port 1883 with the following credentials:\
username: **dombus**\
password: **secretpasswd**\
To disable mosquitto service, just run **sudo systemctl disable mosquitto**

To connect the DomBusGateway telnet interface, first connect DomBusGatewayPIS by SSH, then run the command **telnet localhost 8023**


# Telnet command line interface

It's possible to connect dombusgateway by telnet in this way:

**telnet localhost 8023**

Telnet commands:

* _help_ : **print list of commands**

* _refresh_ : send list of all devices to the domotic controller

* _refresh reset_ : all DomBus entities are removed and created as new, so you can loose configuration, entity names, ...

* _showbus BUS_ : **list modules attached to the specified bus** (it's possible to connect 20-30 modules to the same bus, but for safety reasons it can be good to differentiate bus by floors or by area to manage very large buildings). For example _showbus 2_ to list modules attached to bus #2<br clear="all" /> 
![showbus command](https://images.creasol.it/showbus.webp)

* _showmodule ADDR_ : **list ports associated to the specified module**. For example _showmodule 3701_ to list ports and configuration for the module with address 3701.
In case that more than 1 bus is installed, this command should be performed after a _showbus N_ module to select the bus number N, or the first bus will be automatically selected.

* _setport 1 HWADDR=101_ : **set the new address 101 for the current module**. A unique address should be specified, in hex format, from 1 to efff.

* _setport PORT CONFIGURATION_ : **change the configuration of the specified port**. For example _setport 1 IN_COUNTER,DIVIDER=2000_ to configure port1 in counter mode, type energy meter with pulsed output, 2000 pulses / kWh. This command can be issued only after a _showmodule ADDR_ to select the appropriate module.<br clear="all" /> 
![setport command example](https://images.creasol.it/setport.webp)
![setport command example](https://images.creasol.it/dombusgateway_setport.webp)

* _quit_: exit from telnet session.


# DomBusEVSE module to build a DIY EV charger
Wiring diagrams to make the charging station, single phase or three phase, is available at <a href="https://www.creasol.it/EVSE">www.creasol.it/EVSE</a>

**The EVSE module is programmed to work, by default, with two energy meters** (one to measure the Grid power, and one to measure the EV power, energy, voltage, PF) connected to the 2nd RS485 bus available on the module: in this case the charging station can work independently from the home automation system.

**As most probably the user already have an energy meter measuring grid power (sometimes included in hybrid solar inverters), it's possible to avoid installing a new energy meter for the grid power by implementing a simple automation that sends the current value of power from the grid**, positive when importing energy, negative when exporting, **to the *P0c Grid Power* entity**. Similarly, for buildings having a stationary battery, it's good to send to the EVSE module the value *Power_from_the_grid* + *Power_from_the_battery* : in this case, when charging the EV in *Solar* mode, the EVSE module works to have *P0c Grid Power*=0 that means *"do not use energy from the grid, nor energy from the stationary battery, but consume only energy from the photovoltaic"*. The same in case of wind, hydro or other power sources. In this case the charging station needs that home automation system works, sending the right value of power from the Grid or Grid-Battery.
In this case you have to configure *P0c Grid Power* as a number entity, in this way:
* open a telnet connection with DomBusGateway _telnet localhost 8023_
* select bus, if needed (default=bus1) _showbus 2_
* select EVSE module _showmodule ffe3_
* set port 0c as platform number, with min value = -12000W and max value = 12000W (depending by your solar and contractual power)  _setport c p=number,min=-12000,max=12000_

Example of an automation for HA that sends (ImportPower - ExportPower) to the *P0c Grid Power* device:

```
- id: '1750798854962'
  alias: power2wallbox
  description: 'Sends Grid power value to the wallbox'
  triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
    - sensor.dombus_1201_p07_io7	# Grid import power value (0 while exporting)
    - sensor.dombus_1201_p08_io8	# Grid export power value (0 while importing)
  conditions: []
  actions:
  - service: number.set_value 
    target:
      entity_id: number.dbevse_ffe3_on_bus_2_p0c_grid_power		# Entity name of P0c EVSE module
    data:
      value: >
        {{ (states('sensor.dombus_1201_p07_io7') | float) - (states('sensor.dombus_1201_p08_io8') | float) }}
  mode: single
```

## Creasol DomBus modules

Below a list of modules, produced in Italy by Creasol, designed for high reliability and optimized for very very low power consumption.

Our industrial and home automation modules are designed to be
* very low power &rArr; **10÷15mW with relays OFF**
* reliable &rArr; **no disconnections**
* wired network (bus) &rArr; **no radiofrequency interference, no battery to replace**

Modules are available in two versions:
1. with **DomBus proprietary protocol**, suitable for every type of DomBus modules, working with [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com) by using the Creasol DomBus plugin, and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) ... by using the [DomBusGateway software, a DomBus 2 MQTT-AutoDiscovery interface](https://www.creasol.it/DomBusGateway)
2. with **Modbus standard protocol**, suitable for relays modules, EVSE and Dual Axis solar tracker, working with almost any building automation system supporting Modbus

What version is the best? DomBus version, because:

**Modbus** is a standard protocol Master/Slave: the controller must poll each module to get its status, so it's **not suitable to manage inputs and counters that change frequently**, but can be used to manage relay outputs or read inputs status every 2-5s

**DomBus** is a proprietary multi-master protocol where **each module is able to initiate the communication with the master** to notify, for example, an input change, with a short latency (<100ms) that permits to **manage alarm sensors in a reliable way**. Also, DomBus supports the so-called DCMD, **commands exchanged between modules as KNX does**, so it's possible to program simple automations that work between modules even if the domotic controller is OFF (for example, short pulse on button to toggle a light ON/OFF, 1s pulse to open the garage door, 2s pulse to turn OFF some lights, ...)

Complete solution to make a Smart EVSE, **charging the electric vehicle using only energy from renewable source (photovoltaic, wind, ...), or adding 25-50-75-100% of available power from the grid**.

* **Single-phase and three-phase**, up to 32A (8kW or 22kW)
* Needs external contactor, RCCB (protection) and EV cable
* Optional power meter to measure charging power, energy, voltage and power factor
* Optional power meter to measure the power usage from the grid (not needed if already exists)
* **Two max grid power thresholds** can be programmed: for example, in Italy who have 6kW contractual power can drain from the grid Max (6* 1.27)=7.6kW for max 90 minutes followed by (6* 1.1)=6.6kW for another 90 minutes: in this case **the EVSE module can drain ALL available power** when programmed to charge at 100% **minimizing the charge time and increasing the charging efficiency**.
* **Works without the domotic controller** (stand-alone mode), and **can also work in *managed mode*, with an automation in the home automation system setting the charging current**
